This repository showcases a frontend solution developed to address four distinct challenges, with a focus on web front-end development. Each challenge has been successfully resolved and thoroughly documented.

**App:** https://marlonrt.github.io/Desafio-Frontend/

## Challenges and Solutions

Here are the four challenges addressed along with their respective solutions:

1. **Palindrome Numbers:**
   - Solved using a JavaScript algorithm that identifies palindrome numbers within a user-specified range.

2. **Change Calculator:**
   - Implemented a calculator determining the minimum change to be given, considering 1, 10, and 100 reais notes.

3. **Vehicle Management:**
   - Created a "Vehicle" interface and "Car" and "Motorbike" classes to collect and store information about vehicles. The data is saved in a JSON file.

4. **ZIP Code Lookup:**
   - Users can input multiple ZIP Codes, and the application consumes the ViaCEP API to retrieve detailed information about these ZIP Codes. The data is displayed on the screen, and there's a bonus integration with a map showing the ZIP Codes marked with "pins."

## Technologies Used

The application was developed using the following technologies and resources:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Google Maps API (for map integration)
- ViaCEP API (for ZIP Code information retrieval)

## Bonus Features

The variable `cepHistory` stores all the ZIP Codes searched by the client in an array. A distinctive aspect of this solution is the integration with the Google Maps API, displaying a map with ZIP Codes marked as "pins."

## How to Run
